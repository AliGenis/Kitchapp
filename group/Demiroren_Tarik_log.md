worked on recipe ui. I learned how to use searchView and listView. I updated  recipe class and added recipeList class.

### ~ 21/12/2020 - 27/12/2020 ~
we worked on firebase database and later switched to a local database(android room database). I worked on user settings ui
we cancelled the feature afterwards tho. I created the recipe prepopulation method and added first couple of recipes. Later 
worked together with my friends to fix ui, to fix some bugs and to polish the application further.
