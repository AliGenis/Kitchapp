Most of the screens' user interfaces are done. We are able to add ingredients to Firebase.

*ToDo*     
1.Build Database        
2.We should learn more about intents and clicklisteners for buttons, imageButtons.
3.We need to add bottom navigation bar

**
### Meeting ~ (24/12/2020)
**
*Discussion:* 
We added bottom navigation bar. We tried to add our ingredients to Firebase using HashMap and ArrayList, however we don't think it is straightforward. We might change the way of saving data from Firebase to RoomDatabase
We realized that some of the User interface design are not useful for example we need to use recyclerView instead of adding textView components one by one.

*ToDo*
1. We need to clarify methods of inserting and saving data from Database.
2.Fridge's and recipeList's User Interface designs must be more practical to add listeners so we need to revise their design.

**
### Meeting ~ (25/12/2020)
**
*Discussion:* 
We will use RoomDatabase from now on. We have added interfaces for Ingredient and Recipe implementations, RecyclerAdapter classes are added to list ingredients and recipes.
The way of adding ingredients is changed to make implementation more explicit. From now on the user will add ingredient from seperate page rather than where the user look at the ingredients.

*ToDo*
1.We need to add a screen for looking a particular recipe.
2.Some details should be added to suggestion screen to make it functional.
